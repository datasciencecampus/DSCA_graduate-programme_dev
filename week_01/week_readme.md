# Actions for 2021:

1. Clashes with corporate induction to be mitigated for next year with outlook reminders to contact the team responsible for programming the induction events.  

2. Dashboarding in R to be moved out of week 1, replaced with Basic statistics for Data Science.  

3. Dashboarding in R to be offered as an alternative to Dashboarding in Python, both as a 1 day course. Combined with Business Insight software training in that same week, entitled "Actionable Insights", or some better name.



In 2008, following two high-profile data loss incidents, the Data Handling Procedures in Government review was published. Among other measures, this required all government departments to maintain a register of information assets.
The Security Policy Framework requires that government organisations should appoint and train Information Asset Owners for each of their information assets. Their role is to protect and manage information and to ensure that its value to the organisation is fully exploited.
ONS handles huge amounts of data on a daily basis and our information assets estate is complex.

The security of information is essential to good government and public confidence. To operate effectively, government organisations must maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information.

Government organisations will have:

Staff who are well trained to exercise good judgement, take responsibility and be accountable for the information they handle, including all partner information.

Mechanisms and processes to ensure assets are properly classified and appropriately protected.

Confidence that security controls are effective and that systems and services can protect the information they carry. There will be an overarching programme of information assurance driven by the Board.

As an Information Asset Owner or Liaison Officer, you play a vital role in information security and in leading a culture that takes security seriously.

The role of the Information Asset Owner (IAO)
Information Asset Owners (IAOs) are senior/responsible individuals working in a relevant business area.




Their role is to understand what information is held within their assets, what is added and what is removed, how information is moved, who has access and why. As a result they are able to understand and address risks to the information, and ensure that information is fully used within the law for the public good.

Extracted from The Role of the IAO in UK Government (May 2018)


In addition to the role as described above, IAOs provide written input to the Chief Security Officer and Head of Knowledge and Information Management annually (in November/December) on the security and use of their assets.

Within ONS the IAO role has generally been considered part of a divisional director's responsibilities. However, there is no hard-and-fast rule that an IAO must be of a specific grade. As the register expands to cover all of the information and data we hold, it makes sense for ownership of medium and low sensitivity assets to be delegated to managers below SCS level.

When identifying a suitable IAO, consider the sensitivity of the information (as calculated using the data sensitivity assessment covered later in this course), and the risk to the information asset rather than the size of the asset. The IAO need not be the creator, or even the primary user of the asset, but they must have a good understanding of what the business needs from the asset and how it is used. 


If you are an IAO you will be responsible for your information assets in terms of:

Identifying risks associated with the information asset;
Managing and operating the asset in compliance with policies and standards; and
Ensuring controls are in place to manage all risks appropriately.
The role is flexible and may be implemented differently across divisions. Most of our IAOs are SCS but the KIM Team encourage DDs to delegate the responsibilities for medium and low sensitivity assets to G6/7 level. It is more important that the relevant activities of the role of IAO are performed; not necessarily who does them.

Information Asset Management Model
The first model ONS created was management of information assets based on business structure: directors and divisional directors were given the role of Information Asset Owner, responsible for whichever assets were owned and used within their divisions.
The role of Information Asset Liaison Officer (IALO) was created to support the IAOs in this work: the IALO would manage the assets on a day-to-day basis, while the IAO was the person ultimately responsible for security and information assurance.
Under this model, the IALO role was often taken on by the DDâ€™s support team, rather than by someone familiar with the assets.

To effectively manage our information assets estate, and meet our obligations under legislation, the ONS Data Governance Committee has agreed a new model. Briefly,

The IAO role should be taken by staff of a senior grade, but is no longer restricted to SCS (the appropriate grade depends on the value and sensitivity of the information asset).
The IALO must be a person familiar with the information and how it is used, ideally in a supervisory role.
IALOs can nominate one or more people as deputy/support: this role can be taken by

Alternate contacts who will take on the responsibilities of the IALO in their absence; or
Business support staff who co-ordinate activities for the division.
