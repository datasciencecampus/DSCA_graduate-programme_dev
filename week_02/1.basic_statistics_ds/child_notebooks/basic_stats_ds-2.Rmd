# Bivariate Analysis

This means analysing the distribution of two variables together. Like high school science, as I change x, what happens to y? To continue with our `sleep` data, we should investigate the distribution of the `extra` hours of sleep column for each of the drugs administered, recorded in the `group` column. 

## Exercise 4b
We need to create separate boxplots for each drug administered.

### Python <i class="fab fa-python"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

`seaborn` has the advantage of allowing you to specify which variable to map to the x and y aesthetics. this will allow us to achieve distinct boxplots for each drug administered.

#### Your Code

```{python eval=FALSE}
# Suggest using seaborn for simplicity here
import seaborn as sns
# create a boxplot, administered drug on x, hours additional sleep on y
# save as box_1 for use later

# set the y label as something more descriptive

# don't forget to show the plot

```


#### Hint

```{python eval=FALSE}
# Suggest using seaborn for simplicity here
import seaborn as sns
# create a boxplot, administered drug on x, hours additional sleep on y
# save a box_1 for use later
box_1 = ...........(x=....., y=....., data=........)
# set the y label as something more descriptive
box_1....(ylabel=...)
# don't forget to show the plot
plt.....()
```

#### Solution

```{python, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Suggest using seaborn for simplicity here
import seaborn as sns
# create a boxplot, administered drug on x, hours additional sleep on y
# save a box_1 for use later
box_1 = sns.boxplot(x="group", y="extra", data=sleep_py)
# set the y label as something more descriptive
box_1.set(ylabel='Additional hours sleep against control group')
# don't forget to show the plot
plt.show()
```

### R <i class="far fa-registered"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Using the first argument of the `boxplot` function, you can specify a formula to group on, using the `y~x` syntax. This would mean, for every value of x, draw me a boxplot of the y variable. This tends to only make sense when x is categorical (or discretized, placed in bins).

#### Your Code

```{r}
# create a boxplot, save it for use again as box_1

  # specify a formula that produces separate boxplots of additional sleep for each drug

  # ensure the correct object is passed to the data argument

  #specify a suitable y axis

  
```


#### Hint

```{r eval=FALSE}
# create a boxplot, save it for use again as box_1
box_1 <- ........(
  # specify a formula that produces separate boxplots of additional sleep for each drug
  formula = .....~.....,
  # ensure the correct object is passed to the data argument
  data = .......,
  #specify a suitable y axis
  ylab = ...
  )
  
```


#### Solution

```{r}
# create a boxplot, save it for use again as box_1

boxplot(
  # specify a formula that produces separate boxplots of additional sleep for each drug
  formula = extra~group,
  # ensure the correct object is passed to the data argument
  data = sleep_r,
  #specify a suitable y axis
  ylab = "Additional hours sleep against control group"
  )
  
```

###



## Exercise 4c

One crucial element of the data that a boxplot does not communicate by default is the number of observations. How can we be sure that the number of individuals exposed to each drug? We can resolve this by adding an additional layer to our plots, plotting the points. In this way we can identify if any of the boxplot groups have only have a few observations, which can lead to strange-looking boxes.

### Python <i class="fab fa-python"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Begin with the `box_1` boxplot we created with `seaborn` in the previous exercise. Add a swarm plot layer to the plot, visualising the points for each boxplot.

#### Your Code

```{python eval=FALSE}
# given code from the previous exercise
box_1 = sns.boxplot(x="group", y="extra", data=sleep_py)
# add a swarmplot layer to box_1, specify a colour and alpha values of your choosing

#show the plot


```

#### Hint

```{python eval=FALSE}
# given code from the previous exercise
box_1 = sns.boxplot(x="group", y="extra", data=sleep_py)
# add a swarmplot layer to box_1, specify a colour and alpha values of your choosing
box_1 = .............(x=..., y=..., data=..., color=..., alpha=...)
#show the plot
plt.show()

```

#### Solution

```{python}
# given code from the previous exercise
box_1 = sns.boxplot(x="group", y="extra", data=sleep_py)
# add a swarmplot layer to box_1, specify a colour and alpha values of your choosing
box_1 = sns.swarmplot(x="group", y="extra", data=sleep_py, color=".25", alpha=0.6)
#show the plot
plt.show()

```



### R <i class="far fa-registered"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

#### Your Code

```{r}
# start with a new plot canvas


# #given code from previous exercise
# boxplot(
#   # specify a formula that produces separate boxplots of additional sleep for each drug
#   formula = extra~group,
#   # ensure the correct object is passed to the data argument
#   data = sleep_r,
#   #specify a suitable y axis
#   ylab = "Additional hours sleep against control group"
#   )

# include points on the plot, specifying the colour code as 2



```


#### Hint

```{r eval=FALSE}
# start with a new plot canvas
plot....()

#given code from previous exercise
boxplot(
  # specify a formula that produces separate boxplots of additional sleep for each drug
  formula = extra~group,
  # ensure the correct object is passed to the data argument
  data = sleep_r,
  #specify a suitable y axis
  ylab = "Additional hours sleep against control group"
  )

# include points on the plot, specifying the colour code as 2
......(x = sleep_r$....., y = sleep_r$....., ... = 2)


```

#### Solution

```{r}
# start with a new plot canvas
plot.new()

#given code from previous exercise
boxplot(
  # specify a formula that produces separate boxplots of additional sleep for each drug
  formula = extra~group,
  # ensure the correct object is passed to the data argument
  data = sleep_r,
  #specify a suitable y axis
  ylab = "Additional hours sleep against control group"

<strong class="navy">Pause for thought</strong> <i class="fa fa-question-circle" id="body"></i> 

If there was a lot more data in our examples, what could be done to avoid <strong class="navy">overplotting</strong>?

<!-- TODO --JM worth giving an answer here for how to deal with this, not everyone will work it out -->

***

## Scatter Charts

One of the first steps in exploring datasets may be to produce column summaries or possibly scatter charts, to help visually assess the <strong src="navy">correlation</strong> of any two variables within the data. Health warning! I'm sure you come across this all the time, but it happens for a good reason:

<img class="center" src="../../../www/week_2/causality.jpg" alt="Funny picture of men pushing a van to exemplify the difference between correlation and causation">


Please ensure you are conservative with any language you use in this area. Some prerequisites to being able to claim causation would be:

* A scientific method controlling for other influencing variables.
* Documentation of confounding factors.
* A falsifiable scientific mechanism.
* Peer review to ensure reproducibility of your findings.

If you are involved in research, you may eventually arrive at making causal arguments. Otherwise, avoid like the plague.

<span class="quote" id="block-quote">"There appears to be a positive trend between x and y."</span> <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>


<span class="quote" id="block-quote">"X and y show a positive correlation."</span> <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>

<span class="quote" id="block-quote">"Yay! X is causing y to increase and nobody has ever found this out before and I can't wait to tell you, the reader, all about it and I'm sure I will go down in history as the clevererest analyst ever to have worked for the civil service."</span> <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i>

Scatter charts are an indispensable tool for analysing how 2 variables (or more) vary with one another.

## Correlation Coefficients

After visually assessing trends between variables, we may wish to quantify that trend with a <strong class="navy">summary statistic</strong>. Here's where a correlation coefficient comes in handy. There are a bunch of them for all occasions and it pays to do a bit of reading around the topic, although beyond the scope of this course. All coefficients we will be calculating here should be <strong class="navy">Pearson's</strong>, which is often the default argument. Take care to confirm this when calculating these coefficients.

Developing a familiarity with scatter chart trends and correlation coefficients is a good idea. Take a look at these charts:

<img src="../../../www/week_2/correlation-coefficient.png" class="center" alt="Five scatter charts exemplifying different types of trends and their correlation coefficients">

This is a nice image (one of the better ones that Google returned), but would you agree with everything?

When writing about correlation coefficients and their meaning, it can be useful to have a guide for how to characterise the strength of the correlation. Luckily, there are established conventions for just this. Please see the below table for guidance.

<img src="../../../www/week_2/corr_table.png" class="center" alt="Table of coefficients and their interpretations">



## Exercise 5

This time we will be working with the `trees` data from the `datasets` R package. 

<strong class="navy">Girth, Height and Volume for Black Cherry Trees</strong>

<strong class="navy">Description</strong>

This data set provides measurements of the girth, height and volume of timber in 31 felled black cherry trees. Note that girth is the diameter of the tree (in inches) measured at 4 ft 6 in above the ground.

<strong class="navy">Format</strong>

A data frame with 31 observations on 3 variables.

<strong class="navy">Girth</strong>	numeric	Tree diameter in inches

<strong class="navy">Height</strong>	numeric	Height in ft

<strong class="navy">Volume</strong>	numeric	Volume of timber in cubic ft

<img src="../../../www/week_2/cherry_trees.jpg" class="center">


## Exercise 5a

If following along in python, use `trees_py`, if in R it's `trees_r`.


```{r include=FALSE}
#prep chunk
trees_r <- trees
```


```{python include=FALSE}
#prep chunk
trees_py = r.trees_r
# cache to binary for use in spyder
# pd.to_pickle(trees_py, "cache/trees_py.pkl")

```


### Python <i class="fab fa-python"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

#### Your Code
```{python}
# Need an executable line to avoid error...
import seaborn as sns
# produce a scatter chart of Girth against Volume, need to use lmplot on my version of seaborn

# show the plot

```


#### Hint

```{python eval=FALSE}
# Need an executable line to avoid error...
import seaborn as sns
# produce a scatter chart of Girth against Volume, need to use lmplot on my version of seaborn
sns.lmplot(x=..., y=..., data=..., fit_reg=False)
# show the plot
...()

```

#### Solution

```{python}
# Need an executable line to avoid error...
import seaborn as sns
# produce a scatter chart of Girth against Volume, need to use lmplot on my version of seaborn
sns.lmplot(x="Girth", y="Volume", data=trees_py, fit_reg=False)
# show the plot
plt.show()

```


#### Correlation

```{python}
#import pearsons
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

# calculate corr coefficient
r, p = pearsonr(trees_py.Girth, trees_py.Volume)
# print the coefficient rounded to 2 dp
print(round(r, 2))

```


###


<strong class="navy">Pause for thought</strong> <i class="fa fa-question-circle" id="body"></i> 

How would you describe the apparent trend in the data? Did you estimate the correlation coefficient correctly?


### R <i class="far fa-registered"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

1. Clear the plotting canvas
2. Make a scatter chart between `Girth` and `Volume`.
3. Once you've plotted the trend, have a guess at the <strong class="navy">correlation coefficient</strong>. Then click on the <strong class="navy">Correlation</strong> tab to see if you were right.


#### Your Code

```{r}
# clear the plotting canvas

# produce a scatter chart of Girth against Volume

```

#### Hint

```{r eval=FALSE}
# clear the plotting canvas
........()
# produce a scatter chart of Girth against Volume
plot(x = ..., ..., col=1)
```

#### Solution

```{r}
# clear the plotting canvas
plot.new()
# produce a scatter chart of Girth against Volume
plot(x = trees_r$Girth, trees$Volume, col=1)
```


#### Correlation

```{r}
# calculate the correlation coefficient for Girth vs Volume, rounded to 2dp
round(cor(x = trees_r$Girth, trees$Volume, method = "pearson"), digits = 2)

```


###


<strong class="navy">Pause for thought</strong> <i class="fa fa-question-circle" id="body"></i> 

How would you describe the apparent trend in the data? Did you estimate the correlation coefficient correctly?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, `Girth` against `Volume` resulted in a very high correlation coefficient. How do you think the coefficient for `Height` and `Volume` compare? Reason this out in your head before moving on to the next exercise.

***

## Exercise 5b

This time plot `Height` against `Volume`. As before, visually assess the trend and attempt to guess the correlation coefficient.



### Python <i class="fab fa-python"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

#### Your Code

```{python}
# Need an executable line to avoid error...
import seaborn as sns
# produce a scatter chart of Height against Volume, using sns.lmplot

# show the plot

```


#### Hint

```{python eval=FALSE}
# Need an executable line to avoid error...
import seaborn as sns
# produce a scatter chart of Height against Volume, using sns.lmplot
sns.lmplot(x=..., y=..., data=..., fit_reg=False)
# show the plot
...()

```

#### Solution

```{python}
# Need an executable line to avoid error...
import seaborn as sns
# produce a scatter chart of Height against Volume, using sns.lmplot
sns.lmplot(x="Height", y="Volume", data=trees_py, fit_reg=False)
# show the plot
plt.show()

```


#### Correlation

```{python}
#import pearsons
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

# calculate corr coefficient
r, p = pearsonr(trees_py.Height, trees_py.Volume)
# print the coefficient rounded to 3 dp
print(round(r, 3))

```


### R <i class="far fa-registered"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

#### Your Code

Clear the plotting canvas and plot the requested scatter chart.

```{r eval}
# clear the plotting canvas

# produce a scatter chart of Height against Volume

```

#### Hint

Clear the plotting canvas and plot the requested scatter chart.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# clear the plotting canvas
.....new()
# produce a scatter chart of Height against Volume
....(x = trees_r$..., y = trees$..., col=1)

```


#### Solution

Clear the plotting canvas and plot the requested scatter chart.

```{r}
# clear the plotting canvas
plot.new()
# produce a scatter chart of Height against Volume
plot(x = trees_r$Height, y = trees$Volume, col=1)

```


#### Correlation

```{r}
# calculate the correlation coefficient for Height vs Volume, round to 3 dp
round(cor(x = trees_r$Height, trees$Volume, method = "pearson"), digits = 3)

```


###

Hopefully this has ensured that we have all developed an intuition for scatter chart trend and correlation coefficients. But when exploring data, analysis in this way could be very time consuming if the dataset contains lots of numerical variables. Thankfully, there are ways to quickly assess the correlation coefficients of all variables present in a dataframe.

Some correlation functions are capable of accepting a whole dataframe as an argument, rather than simply `x` and `y`, as I used in the <strong class="navy>correlation</strong> tabs in the previous exercise. Sometimes you may need to drop any columns that are not numerical, depending on the function you are using. Typically, you will return a matrix of correlation coefficients, for all numeric data. These have been calculated two at a time, or <strong class="navy">pairwise</strong>.

## Pairwise Correlation

Here we will be considering the `airquality` dataframe from the `datasets` package in R.

![Chimney stacks and pylons against sunset skyline](../../../www/week_2/pollution.jpg)


<strong class="navy">New York Air Quality Measurements</strong>

<strong class="navy">Description</strong>

Daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973.

<strong class="navy">Format</strong>

A data frame with 154 observations on 6 variables.

<strong class="navy">Ozone</strong>	numeric	Ozone (parts per billion)  
<strong class="navy">Solar.R</strong>	numeric	Solar R (langleys)  
<strong class="navy">Wind</strong>	numeric	Wind (mph)  
<strong class="navy">Temp</strong>	numeric	Temperature (degrees F)  
<strong class="navy">Month</strong>	numeric	Month (1--12)  
<strong class="navy">Day</strong>	numeric	Day of month (1--31)  

Type `?airquality` in an R console or code chunk for more detail.

```{r echo=FALSE}

airquality %>% 
  cor() %>%
  knitr::kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

```

<strong class="navy">Pause for thought</strong> <i class="fa fa-question-circle" id="body"></i> 

As you can see, there is a problem with the `Ozone` and `Solar.R` columns as no correlation coefficients were returned for those columns. What do you think happened?

Hint: This is a problem with the calculation of many summary statistics and functions usually have optional arguments designed to handle just this issue. 

I'm going to go ahead and process the dataframe to ensure I can also return coefficients for the 2 problem columns. Pay close attention to the resulting coefficients.


```{r echo=FALSE}

aq_filtered <- airquality[complete.cases(airquality), ]

cor(aq_filtered) %>% knitr::kable() %>% kable_styling()

```

In order to achieve a full correlation matrix, I had to remove all rows where <strong class="navy">any of the variables contained missing values</strong>. Great! This has improved the analysis and would now let me get on with the important work of completing my report. <strong class="navy">Possibly not.</strong>

We now have a full correlation matrix but <strong class="navy">beware!</strong> I removed `r nrow(airquality) - nrow(aq_filtered)` rows from the dataframe and this has affected <strong class="navy">all</strong> of the correlation coefficients returned. What if the number of rows with missing data had been considerably more?

<strong class="navy">Pause for thought</strong> <i class="fa fa-question-circle" id="body"></i>

Could there be a pattern in the missing data? Is it sensible to suggest that days of very low temperature could result in missing readings for solar radiation? Could this be more common in certain months than others?

How could this affect the results of your summary statistics? How could it affect analyses and any supervised learning that you could apply to this dataset? 

<span class="summary-box">Be very careful when handling missing data. Ensure that your decisions are well documented and that you take the time to explore the data in its entirety before making the decision to drop rows. Discuss these decisions with project managers and domain experts.</span>


***

## Exercise 6a

As in the last exercise, we will use `trees` from R's `datasets` package.

Calculate the pairwise correlation matrix for all of the data in this dataframe. Remember, you will be using either `trees_r` or `trees_py` depending on the language you are following along in.

### Python <i class="fab fa-python"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}


#### Your Code

Use `pandas` to calculate the pairwise correlations of the `trees_py` dataframe.

```{python eval=FALSE}
# Need an executable line to avoid error...
import pandas as pd

# calculate corr coefficient

```

#### Hint

Use `pandas` to calculate the pairwise correlations of the `trees_py` dataframe.

```{python eval=FALSE}
# Need an executable line to avoid error...
import pandas as pd

# calculate corr coefficient
.........corr()
```


#### Solution

Use `pandas` to calculate the pairwise correlations of the `trees_py` dataframe.

```{python}
# Need an executable line to avoid error...
import pandas as pd

# calculate corr coefficient
trees_py.corr()
```


### R <i class="far fa-registered"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}


#### Your Code

Use the correlation function from the `stats` package to calculate the pairwise correlations for the `trees_r` dataframe.

```{r}
# calculate correlation coefficients for all variables in the trees_r dataframe



```

#### Hint

Use the correlation function from the `stats` package to calculate the pairwise correlations for the `trees_r` dataframe.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# calculate correlation coefficients for all variables in the trees_r dataframe
cor(...)


```

#### Solution

Use the correlation function from the `stats` package to calculate the pairwise correlations for the `trees_r` dataframe.

```{r}
# calculate correlation coefficients for all variables in the trees_r dataframe
cor(trees_r)


```

## Exercise 6b

It's also possible to do the same pairwise trend analysis with scatter charts instead of correlation coefficients. This can be a bit overwhelming on larger dataframes, but still useful, nonetheless. 

### Python <i class="fab fa-python"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

#### Solution

Do you happen to know the correct function to do this? I've used `seaborn` in my example.

```{python}
# need an executable line to avoid error...
import seaborn as sns
# use the correct function from seaborn

# show the plots

```

#### Hint

Do you happen to know the correct function to do this? I've used `seaborn` in my example.

```{python eval=FALSE}
# need an executable line to avoid error...
import seaborn as sns
# use the correct function from seaborn
sns....(trees_py)
# show the plots
plt.show()
```


#### Solution

Do you happen to know the correct function to do this? I've used `seaborn` in my example.

```{python}
# need an executable line to avoid error...
import seaborn as sns
# use the correct function from seaborn
sns.pairplot(trees_py)
# show the plots
plt.show()
```


### R <i class="far fa-registered"></i> {.tabset .tabset-fade}

#### Your Code

Do you happen to know the correct function? It's in the `graphics` package that comes with your base installation.

```{r}
# visualise the same pairwise correlations with scatter charts in one line


```


#### Hint

Do you happen to know the correct function? It's in the `graphics` package that comes with your base installation.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# visualise the same pairwise correlations with scatter charts in one line
pa....(trees_r)

```

#### Solution

Do you happen to know the correct function? It's in the `graphics` package that comes with your base installation.

```{r}
# visualise the same pairwise correlations with scatter charts in one line
pairs(trees_r)

```
